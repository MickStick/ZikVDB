			<p >
				The Non-Structural Protein NS1 is a gene sequence obtained from the Zika Virus Genome. It is one
                                of the various nucleotide sequences within the Zika Virus Genome that codes for its different
                                functions. For the purpose of the research by biological experts, it can be obtained by visiting
				the NCBI Zika Virus Resource Page and then downloading the Zika Virus Reference Genome. Next,
                                isolate the NS1 from the entire Zika Genome by using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
                                (MEGA) tool.

				<p>Biological experts can also use the NS1 gene sequence in research as well as in the fight against
                                   the Zika Virus. The NS1 gene sequence was further analyzed by entering the sequence into the Primer
                                   BLAST tool to obtain a primer pair that can be utilized in bioinformatics techniques. The primers obtained
                                   were utilized with ePCR, which is a technique that allows for the simulation of the process of Transcription
                                   and Translation which allows for replication of the sequence for different purposes (e.g. forensics, research,
                                   DNA matching). The primer pair can be used to identify the presence of the Zika Virus in an individual. Furher
                                   information on this can be found further down below this page. </p>

				<h4 class="sect-title one-third-title"> ORF Finder <hr/></h4>				
				<p>This is where the breakthroughs needed to fight the Zika Virus come in. While in the research conducted this tool
                                   was used to confirm that the NS1 gene sequence came from the Zika Virus. This process can be applied in the field
                                   as well. An open reading frame is the sequence expressed that codes for a protein. The results can also be found
                                   below in the slideshow. </p>

			<div class="one-third">
				<h4 class="sect-title one-third-title"> ePCR <hr/></h4>				
				<p>The Electronic PCR was used to properly identify Zika Virus after analysis of the primer pair obtained from the research
                                   conducted on the NS1 gene sequence. The shows that the primer pair obtained could identify the presence of the Zika Virus
                                   in subjects. This was ensured through also using Reverse E-PCR and making the dataset the Homo sapiens genome. In short, this
                                   allowed for the determination of whether or not the primers would mistake any other sequence within humans for the Zika Virus
                                   and bind to any part of the human genome. The results returned after searching revealed that no match was found for all the
                                   three primers that were used. The primers obtained are effective in the fight against the Zika Virus. The results can be found
                                   below for further reference. 

                                   NOTICE: Biological experts should also use this technique on diseases similar to the Zika Virus like Dengue Fever, before use. </p>

					<h4 class="sect-title one-quarter-title"> NEB Cutter <hr/></h4>				
					<p>This algorithm helped in the identification of the restriction enzymes that can cut the NS1 gene and consequently be used
                                           to make a DNA fingerprint of the gene. Below we can observe where the restriction enzyme N1aIV cuts the gene into 4 different
                                           fragments ((1-93), (94-648), (649-851), (852-1168)). Based on how the gene is separated by the various restriction enzymes the
                                           DNA fingerprint can then be determined. </p>

                                           is analyzed using bioinformatics tool like MEGA. The report also shows the places the NS1 gene sequence was also found, what type
                                           of organism the host was and in what year or period. Thanks to this technology, biological experts will be glad to know that the
                                           NS1 gene sequence can most surely be used for this technique. The results showed that the main host of the Zika Virus was the human
